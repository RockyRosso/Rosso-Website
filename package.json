  "description": "Rosso Website is a website to show off Rocky Rosso's projects on Roblox, or outside of it. It contains blogs, a gallery of projects, and more coming soon such as a chat room, etc. This site is purely a passion project. So no microtransactions will ever be implemented into the site. Have fun exploring!\r ## Acknowledgements\r - Netlify (Hosting)\r - W3 Schools (Help with HTML and CSS)\r - Google Fonts (Site Fonts)\r ---\r https://rocky-rosso.xyz",
